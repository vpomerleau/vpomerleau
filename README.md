## Current work

I'm a software engineer, currently on contract with Mozilla's [Firefox Accounts (Fxa)](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa) team. I'm super proud to be contributing to Mozilla's mission to make the internet better for everyone. 

Recently, we've been working on a big push to refactor part of Firefox accounts from `backbone` to `react`. My work has been focused on recreating the front-end of the pages currently in production with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), including building out the [Storybooks](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) tests with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/).

## Some things I'm excited about 💖

- Firefox accounts is a complex system with a lot of moving pieces - I'm learning and growing as a developer every single day by tackling new issues, pairing with other devs on the team, and learning from other devs who are more experienced and/or who focus on a different part of the stack!

- Part of my background is in translation 💬, so I've been really enjoying collaborating with Mozilla's localization (l10n) team to make sure all Firefox accounts strings are localized thanks to Mozilla's [Project Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/), a localization system for natural-sounding translations, and [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/), Mozilla's open-source, contributor-driven localization platform.

## I'm curious about...

- WCAG's new [Accessible Authentication guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication)
- Learning about GraphQL

## Let's talk

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on impactful projects that improve people's lives, and always keen to talk about using code to build joyful and accessible online experiences.

Also - I'm open to discussing roles, contracts starting in April 2023 👀
